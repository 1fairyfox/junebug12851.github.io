# Project Status

_Current state only._ For the chronological history see [`sessions/`](sessions/README.md);
for the commit-by-commit changelog see [`version.md`](version.md).

**Version:** `0.3.0` (single source of truth: repo-root `VERSION`; see
[`reference/versioning.md`](reference/versioning.md)).

## Current state (read this first)

**The site is live** at https://junebug12851.github.io/ and at the **`fairyfox.io`
custom domain** (2026-06-22) — the domain now resolves and serves over **HTTP**;
the GitHub-issued **HTTPS certificate is still provisioning** (enable Enforce HTTPS
once it lands). It's a
clean, custom Jekyll build — no external theme — deployed to GitHub Pages by
GitHub Actions on every push to `main`.

The site is framed as a **project hub + documentation library** for Fairy Fox's
work, written in a neutral documentation voice (not first-person, not glorifying;
see [`context/principles.md`](context/principles.md)). It now includes:

- A **full-bleed, fluid visual design** (0.3.0): full-width section bands instead of
  a single narrow column, a sticky footer, a refined violet/amber palette tuned to
  **WCAG 2.1 AA**, focus-visible outlines, and a reduced-motion guard.
- A **dropdown header nav** (monogram wordmark). The **Projects** menu lists the
  projects and links to each one's on-site `/docs/<key>/` page; the **Updates** menu
  (formerly "Blog") and **Docs** menu round it out.
- A substantially **expanded on-site documentation library** (`/docs/`, the `_docs`
  collection): the ecosystem overview, a **"This site"** group surfacing the whole
  `notes/` tree (architecture, system map, deployment, updates workflow, decisions,
  principles), the **shared standards**, and a per-project doc page.

The rest of the structure is in place end to end:

- **Site:** home, `/projects/`, `/blog/`, `/about/`, a first blog post, RSS feed,
  SEO tags, sitemap. Custom responsive CSS with light/dark.
- **Hub:** [`../hub/`](../hub/) holds the cross-project standards + templates and
  the project registry. This is what other repos pull.
- **Notes:** this living-notes system, mirroring the convention used across my
  projects.
- **Sync:** the pull-only cross-project model is documented
  ([`reference/cross-project-sync.md`](reference/cross-project-sync.md)) and the
  two reference repos are cloned under `assets/references/` (git-ignored).

## In flight / awaiting

- **Warm redesign is LIVE (`0.4.0`).** The new design language (warm palette + Fraunces/
  Inter/JetBrains, light/dark), the **portal home** (hero + live activity panel), the
  **standardized status cards** (lifecycle/version/activity, sorted newest-first with the
  hub last), and the **project node pages** (`/projects/<key>/`) are all shipped — built
  increment-by-increment, each verified with a local `jekyll build` + headless screenshot.
  Direction/plan: [`context/design-direction.md`](context/design-direction.md),
  [`plans/implementation.md`](plans/implementation.md), mockup `mockups/v1-warm.html`.
  **Remaining polish:** the Latest-updates and doc sections; later the generated activity
  pulse + Web-Component live examples (built with Fairy Fox).

- **HTTPS for `fairyfox.io`.** The custom domain is **live over HTTP** (DNS points
  at GitHub Pages and the domain is set in Settings → Pages). The only thing
  outstanding is the **HTTPS certificate**, which GitHub is still provisioning;
  once it issues, enable **Enforce HTTPS** in Settings → Pages. Both project Pages
  sites are served under the domain too (`fairyfox.io/pokered-save-editor-2/`,
  `fairyfox.io/random-ai-prompt/`).

## Next

See [`plans/next-steps.md`](plans/next-steps.md). Headline items: confirm the
first Actions deploy is green, wire DNS for the custom domain, and write the
first real "what changed in my projects" round-up once there's a diff to report.
