# Project Status

_Current state only._ For the chronological history see [`sessions/`](sessions/README.md);
for the commit-by-commit changelog see [`version.md`](version.md).

**Version:** `0.4.0` (single source of truth: repo-root `VERSION`; see
[`reference/versioning.md`](reference/versioning.md)).

## Current state (read this first)

**The site is live** at https://junebug12851.github.io/ and at the **`fairyfox.io`
custom domain** (2026-06-22) — the domain now resolves and serves over **HTTP**;
the GitHub-issued **HTTPS certificate is still provisioning** (enable Enforce HTTPS
once it lands). It's a
clean, custom Jekyll build — no external theme — deployed to GitHub Pages by
GitHub Actions on every push to `main`.

The site is framed as a **project hub + documentation library** for Fairy Fox's
work, written in a neutral documentation voice (not first-person, not glorifying;
see [`context/principles.md`](context/principles.md)). It now includes:

- A distinct **"Midnight Archive" visual identity** (0.4.0): the index pages (home,
  projects, downloads, docs) are built on hairline rules instead of shadowed cards, a
  monospace catalogue system (kickers, statuses, tags, dates, numbered project rows via
  CSS counters), and an editorial type scale — so they no longer read as a generated
  template. The home page has a hero, a prominent **Current focus** feature for the
  active project, numbered catalogue rows for the rest, a lead-plus-rows updates block,
  and a docs+latest-builds band. Built on the earlier full-bleed band layout (0.3.0):
  full-width sections, a sticky footer, a violet/amber palette tuned to **WCAG 2.1 AA**,
  focus-visible outlines, a reduced-motion guard, and light-mode parity.
- A **dropdown header nav** (monogram wordmark). The **Projects** menu lists the
  projects and links to each one's on-site `/docs/<key>/` page; the **Updates** menu
  (formerly "Blog") and **Docs** menu round it out.
- A substantially **expanded on-site documentation library** (`/docs/`, the `_docs`
  collection): the ecosystem overview, a **"This site"** group surfacing the whole
  `notes/` tree (architecture, system map, deployment, updates workflow, decisions,
  principles), the **shared standards**, and a per-project doc page.

The rest of the structure is in place end to end:

- **Site:** home, `/projects/`, `/blog/`, `/about/`, a first blog post, RSS feed,
  SEO tags, sitemap. Custom responsive CSS with light/dark.
- **Hub:** [`../hub/`](../hub/) holds the cross-project standards + templates and
  the project registry. This is what other repos pull.
- **Notes:** this living-notes system, mirroring the convention used across my
  projects.
- **Sync:** the pull-only cross-project model is documented
  ([`reference/cross-project-sync.md`](reference/cross-project-sync.md)) and the
  two reference repos are cloned under `assets/references/` (git-ignored).

## In flight / awaiting

- **HTTPS for `fairyfox.io`.** The custom domain is **live over HTTP** (DNS points
  at GitHub Pages and the domain is set in Settings → Pages). The only thing
  outstanding is the **HTTPS certificate**, which GitHub is still provisioning;
  once it issues, enable **Enforce HTTPS** in Settings → Pages. Both project Pages
  sites are served under the domain too (`fairyfox.io/pokered-save-editor-2/`,
  `fairyfox.io/random-ai-prompt/`).

## Next

See [`plans/next-steps.md`](plans/next-steps.md). Headline items: confirm the
first Actions deploy is green, wire DNS for the custom domain, and write the
first real "what changed in my projects" round-up once there's a diff to report.
