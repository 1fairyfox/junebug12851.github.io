A long day, mostly on the connective tissue of the mesh: the shared standards grew
two substantial pieces, the git model was rewritten, and one of the projects went
from *listed* to genuinely *integrated* — with a small product feature shipped along
the way.

## A node that can check for updates

Picking up the lifecycle-runbook work, each project gained the awareness to **notice**
there are hub changes to adopt in the first place. The adopting-updates runbook now
opens with what a project should do when someone asks whether the hub has anything
newer: the behaviour is an intent to recognise in ordinary conversation — not a fixed
command — and the default is **check-and-report, then stop**. Refresh the read-only
hub clone, diff what changed against what the project has already adopted, report a
short summary of what adopting it would touch, and then wait. Nothing is applied
without an explicit go-ahead.

A follow-up tightened when that flow should fire at all. A bare "check for updates" is
too ambiguous to act on — it could mean the operating system, dependencies, or a
single file — so the request now has to name the fairyfox system explicitly before a
project treats it as a sync check. The whole project lifecycle is now written down end
to end: [setting up a new project](/docs/new-project-setup/), [onboarding an existing
one](/docs/onboarding-existing-project/), and [adopting updates](/docs/adopting-updates/).

## A docs-site design system for every project

The largest new standard of the day is a [docs-site design system](/docs/docs-site/):
the shared look, structure, and cross-linking that make each project's documentation
site feel like one continuous surface with fairyfox.io. It is written as a
specification a project implements in its own stack — design tokens, layout, the
shared components, accessibility, a domain-and-publishing model, and a measurements
reference that pins every value — rather than a stylesheet to copy. The principle is
seamlessness on one domain: every project publishes under `fairyfox.io/<project>/`,
wears the same skin, and links both ways, so the boundary between the hub and a
project disappears. fairyfox.io itself is the master copy and is exempt from
auto-applied theme changes — direction is strictly outward, from the hub into the
projects.

## The git model is now git-flow

The shared [git workflow](/docs/git-workflow/) was rewritten around **git-flow** —
the branching model, not the scripts. `feature/*` branches are the normal unit of
work and `hotfix/*` covers urgent production fixes; every merge into `main` is a
tagged release, always with `--no-ff`. How a release reaches `main` follows the
SemVer level: a **patch** goes directly from `dev`, while a **minor or major** is
staged through a `release/*` branch — ceremony proportional to the change. A related
decision made `main` the mandatory name for the stable branch across the mesh, with a
safe rename path (never a history rewrite) for any repository still on `master`. The
one everyday solo shortcut — a trivial change committed straight on `dev` — remains,
as latitude *within* the model rather than a lighter model of its own.

## Random AI Prompt joins the mesh for real

[Random AI Prompt](/projects/random-ai-prompt/) became the first project to follow the
onboarding runbook all the way through. Being listed in the registry was never the same
as being integrated, and the gap showed: its assistant context carried no mesh
awareness, and its documentation site was still a default-themed generator dump. Both
were closed this day. The project's `CLAUDE.md` gained the standing cross-project
instruction and its guardrails, a project-side record of the sync model was added, and
its JSDoc documentation site was re-skinned from scratch to wear the fairyfox design
system — the dark-first warm palette, the type system, and the two-way links back to
Fairy Fox and to the project's node page. The themed docs go live on the project's next
publish.

## SFW by default

Alongside the mesh work, Random AI Prompt shipped a small but real feature (2.6.1): the
web app now defaults to **safe-for-work**, with a right-aligned **NSFW** toggle in the
top bar as a stopgap until a full options screen lands. The generation engine already
gated on the setting everywhere; it simply had no default and no control surfaced.
Enabling NSFW requires a confirmation step, turning it back off is immediate, and the
choice is remembered in the browser.
