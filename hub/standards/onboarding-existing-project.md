# Onboarding an Existing Project — folding an established repo into the mesh

How to bring a project that **already exists with its own life** — its own
history, README, structure, version scheme, maybe its own docs — into the hub
mesh for the first time. The job here is to **reconcile, not clobber**: layer the
shared standard onto a living repo without rewriting it.

> Canonical, project-agnostic version (the one other repos copy). Sibling
> runbooks: [`new-project-setup.md`](new-project-setup.md) for a *greenfield*
> repo (blank tree), and [`adopting-updates.md`](adopting-updates.md) for pulling
> *later* hub changes once a project is already in. The model behind all three:
> [`cross-project-sync.md`](cross-project-sync.md).

For AI or human. Use this one when the repo predates its membership — there's
existing work on disk you must respect.

## When this is the right runbook

| You have… | Use |
|-----------|-----|
| An empty/new repo you're standing up | [`new-project-setup.md`](new-project-setup.md) |
| **An established repo (own history/README/docs/version) joining for the first time** | **this doc** |
| A project already in the mesh, pulling newer hub changes | [`adopting-updates.md`](adopting-updates.md) |

A project can also legitimately stay **fully outside** the mesh (follows none of
the standards, isn't registered, isn't referenced). Onboard only when the project
should actually participate.

## The end state

Identical to greenfield — see the checklist in
[`new-project-setup.md`](new-project-setup.md#what-fully-set-up-means). The
difference is purely the **path**: every step below is "fit the standard to what's
already here," not "create from blank."

## The governing rule

**Reconcile, don't overwrite.** The repo already encodes decisions — a version
number, a branch model, a README, possibly docs. Adopt the standard by folding it
*around* those, keeping what's good and recording any deliberate divergence. A
blind template copy that flattens existing work is the failure mode this runbook
exists to prevent.

## Steps

### 1. Survey what already exists (before touching anything)

Inventory the repo so you adopt onto reality, not over it:

- **Branch model** — what's the default branch? `main`? `master`? Anything else?
- **Versioning** — is there a `VERSION`, git tags, a `package.json` version, a
  changelog already?
- **Docs** — existing `README`, a `docs/` or wiki, any AI-context file?
- **Ignores / license / CI** — an existing `.gitignore`, `LICENSE`, workflows.

### 2. Decide the branch model — adopt, don't force

The mesh tracks **`dev`** (work) fast-forwarding to **`main`** (stable). If the
repo already fits or can move cheaply, adopt it. **If it lives on `master` and a
rename would be disruptive** (published URLs, others' clones, CI wired to it),
**don't force it** — record the *real* branch in the registry instead and adopt
the rest. The standard is the default, not a mandate that justifies risky history
surgery.

### 3. Pull a read-only copy of the hub

```sh
mkdir -p assets/references
git -C assets/references clone --depth 1 --branch dev \
    https://github.com/junebug12851/junebug12851.github.io fairyfox.io
```

Git-ignored, read-only — never a submodule (see step 4 for the ignore line).

### 4. Adopt the templates by reconciliation

Fold each template in around what's there — never a straight overwrite:

| Template | If absent | If something already exists |
|----------|-----------|-----------------------------|
| `CLAUDE.md` | Copy it in and fill out the project identity, **including the mesh-awareness block** (see below). | Fold the standard's structure into the existing AI-context file, keeping the project's real landmines/build steps — **but you must still add the mesh-awareness block** (see below); an existing `CLAUDE.md` almost never has it. |
| `VERSION` | Create it — but **seed it from the project's actual version** (latest tag / `package.json`), *not* `0.1.0`. Reconcile the scheme toward SemVer. | Leave the real number; just confirm it matches the SemVer rule. |
| `.gitignore` | Add the `assets/references/` ignore (+ cruft). | **Merge** the `assets/references/` line in; don't replace the existing file. |
| `notes/` skeleton | Drop the skeleton in and seed `status.md` from reality. | Add the skeleton *alongside* existing docs; migrate them in over time, not big-bang. |

> **The mesh-awareness block is required — and it's the easiest thing to skip when
> reconciling an existing `CLAUDE.md`.** The project's `CLAUDE.md` must carry the
> **"Cross-project standards & checking the fairyfox system for updates"** standing
> instruction from the template ([`templates/CLAUDE.md`](../templates/CLAUDE.md)) —
> the check-for-updates flow plus its guardrails. Without it the project never
> learns it is a node: it won't respond to "check the fairyfox system for updates"
> and won't know to adopt later changes. A mature project that already has its own
> polished `CLAUDE.md` is the **most likely** place this gets missed — verify it is
> actually present, don't assume.

### 5. Map existing docs into the notes system

Don't duplicate — **relocate or link.** The existing `README` stays the repo
tour; fold deeper material into the `notes/` tree (status, context, reference) and
link out rather than copy. One fact, one home.

### 6. Bring its docs onto the themed docs site *(often incremental)*

Adopt the [docs-site design system](docs-site/) so the project's documentation is
seamless with fairyfox.io — but **reconcile, don't clobber**, the same as the rest
of onboarding:

- If the project already has a docs site (Doxygen output, an existing Pages site),
  **re-skin it toward the theme** and fold its content in rather than discarding it;
  generated API docs stay a boundaried zone
  ([`docs-site/06-content-and-organization.md`](docs-site/06-content-and-organization.md)).
- Add the **required links back** to Fairy Fox and publish at `fairyfox.io/<key>/`
  (set the base path to `/<key>`, no project CNAME —
  [`docs-site/10-domain-and-publishing.md`](docs-site/10-domain-and-publishing.md)).
- This can be **partial on day one** (skin the shell now, deepen later) — mark it
  honestly and tighten via [`adopting-updates.md`](adopting-updates.md). Check
  progress against [`docs-site/08-compliance-checklist.md`](docs-site/08-compliance-checklist.md).

> **Raw generated docs served alone do NOT satisfy this — and don't count as
> "partial" either.** A bare JSDoc / Doxygen / TypeDoc dump at `fairyfox.io/<key>/`,
> with the generator's default theme and no Fairy Fox shell or back-links, is an
> *unthemed boundaried zone with no site around it* — the exact failure this step
> exists to catch. The compliant minimum is a **themed docs site** (the shared
> tokens, header/footer, and the two-way links from
> [`docs-site/05-navigation-and-cross-linking.md`](docs-site/05-navigation-and-cross-linking.md))
> that *wraps and links to* the generated reference. **Verify by actually looking at
> the served page**, not by trusting that a `docs:` URL resolves — a URL that
> resolves to default-theme generator output is a miss, not a pass.

### 7. Register with the hub *(hub-side change)*

A commit **in the hub repo**, not the project:

- Add the entry to [`hub/registry.yml`](../registry.yml) — and set **`branch` to
  the project's real branch** (from step 2), not a wishful `dev`.
- Set `adopts_hub` / `notes_system` **honestly** — partial adoption is fine and
  normal for an existing repo; mark what's actually true today.
- Add the companion row to the site's `_data/projects.yml`.

### 8. Commit on the project's working branch, then fast-forward

Stage specific files (never `-A`; never `assets/references/*`):

```sh
git add CLAUDE.md VERSION .gitignore notes
git commit -m "chore: onboard into hub mesh (adopt standards + notes)"
git push origin <work-branch>
# if on the dev/main model:
git checkout main && git merge --ff-only dev && git push origin main && git checkout dev
```

## Registered ≠ integrated (read before declaring "done")

**Hub-side registration is the easy half and proves almost nothing about whether
the project is actually integrated.** A project can be in both registries, have a
node page, a docs-library entry, and blog posts — and still have done **none** of
the project-side work (no mesh-awareness in its `CLAUDE.md`, no themed docs site).
Listing it on the hub is necessary but **not sufficient**.

So separate the two when you assess or report:

- **Hub side** — registry entries, node/docs pages, blog. (Steps 7.)
- **Project side** — the standards actually living in the repo: the mesh-awareness
  `CLAUDE.md` block, the notes system, the git/version model, and a **themed docs
  site**. (Steps 1–6, 8.)

A project that's only hub-registered is **not onboarded** — it's *listed*. Never
report it as "fully onboarded."

## Partial adoption is fine — *if reported honestly*

An established repo rarely adopts everything on day one — it might take the notes
system now and the full git model later. That's expected: onboard incrementally
and tighten over subsequent passes via [`adopting-updates.md`](adopting-updates.md).
But "partial" is only acceptable when it is **reported as partial, with the
specific gaps named.** Mark the registry flags honestly, and never round a
partially-integrated project up to "done." Joining the mesh is a direction, not a
single switch — say where on the path it actually is.

## Verify — the completeness audit

Run **every** row and report each with its real status — `done`, `partial`, or
**`missing`**. This same audit is what you run to check a project that's *claimed*
to be onboarded; finding `missing` rows means it isn't.

| # | Dimension | Passes only when… |
|---|-----------|-------------------|
| 1 | Working tree | `git status` clean; `assets/references/` untracked/ignored; nothing pre-existing clobbered (README, license, CI, history intact). |
| 2 | Versioning | `VERSION` reflects the project's **real** version (not reset to `0.1.0`), SemVer-shaped. |
| 3 | Branch model | Registry `branch` matches the repo's **actual** default/work branch. |
| 4 | Notes system | The `notes/` tree exists with a real `status.md`; existing docs mapped in, not duplicated. |
| 5 | **Mesh-awareness in `CLAUDE.md`** | The project's `CLAUDE.md` **actually contains** the "Cross-project standards & checking the fairyfox system for updates" standing instruction. **Open the file and confirm the text is there** — don't infer it from the project being registered. |
| 6 | **Themed docs site** | `fairyfox.io/<key>/` serves a site **wearing the fairyfox theme** with the **two-way links back** to Fairy Fox. **Look at the actual page.** Default-theme JSDoc/Doxygen output, or a `docs:` URL that merely resolves, is `missing` — not `partial`. Bar: [`docs-site/08-compliance-checklist.md`](docs-site/08-compliance-checklist.md). |
| 7 | Hub registration | Resolves in **both** registries with honest `adopts_hub` / `notes_system` flags; node + docs pages present. |

**Reporting rule:** only call a project **"fully onboarded" when rows 1–7 are all
`done`.** If any row is `partial` or `missing`, say exactly which — e.g. "registered
and noted, but the docs site is unthemed JSDoc and the `CLAUDE.md` mesh block is
missing." A clean hub-side registration is **not** a green light.

## Gotchas

- **Never rewrite history to fit the standard.** No force-push, no rebase of
  published commits, no branch deletion without an explicit request.
- **Don't reset the version.** Carry the existing number forward.
- **Don't force a `master → main` rename** just for tidiness — record the real
  branch and move on.
- **Honesty over completeness** in the registry — a half-adopted project is a real
  state worth recording accurately.
