  <h2>How the projects connect</h2>
  <p>This site is the hub for the projects above. The shared engineering standards
  they follow are documented in the <a href="/docs/">documentation library</a>, and
  each project pulls those standards from the hub on demand. In the other direction,
  the hub keeps read-only copies of the projects so their changes can be tracked and
  written up. The connections are deliberately loose — git only, no live coupling —
  which keeps each repository independent. The full model is described under
  <a href="/docs/cross-project-sync/">cross-project sync</a>.</p>
  <p>Because the hub uses a custom domain, the projects' own GitHub Pages sites are
  served under it too — for example, <code>fairyfox.io/pokered-save-editor-2/</code>
  — so the navigation can lead straight into a project's documentation.</p>
